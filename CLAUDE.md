# Tamil Aathichudi Draw & Learn Game

## Project Overview
Educational Tamil alphabet learning game for children aged 3-8. Built with React + Phaser 3 framework.

## Current Implementation Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full working Tamil learning game with enhanced features

### Game Features
- **30 Tamil Letters**: 12 vowels (Uyir) + 18 consonants (Mei)
- **Touch-Based Tracing**: Drawing restricted to letter bounds only
- **Scoring System**: 0-100 points per letter with different feedback levels
- **Bigger Text**: 300px font size for better visibility
- **Black Outline Letters**: No fill color, black stroke only
- **Progressive Learning**: All letters work in sequence

### Score-Based Feedback System
- **Below 50**: "Try again" with shake animation - must retry (Next button hidden)
- **50-74**: Basic positive feedback - can proceed to next letter
- **75-89**: Reward animation with star particles ‚≠ê
- **90+**: Big celebration with fireworks, floating stars, rainbow glow üéâ

## Technical Architecture

### Main Files
- **`src/MinimalGame.jsx`** - Primary working game implementation
- **`src/main.jsx`** - React entry point using MinimalGame
- **`src/game/main-simple.js`** - Alternative Phaser configuration (backup)

### Key Components
1. **MinimalScene** - Menu/start screen
2. **DrawingScene** - Main learning interface with tracing functionality

### Game Mechanics
- Touch drawing with bounds detection
- Real-time scoring calculation
- Animation effects based on performance
- Automatic progression through letters
- Completion celebration screen

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server (usually port 8080/8081)
npm run build  # Build for production
```

## Game Flow
1. Start screen with Tamil letters display
2. Click "START LEARNING" to begin
3. Trace each letter within the black outline
4. Receive score and feedback based on performance
5. Progress through all 30 Tamil letters
6. Completion celebration screen

## Animation Features
- **Star Particles**: Burst effect for good scores (75+)
- **Fireworks**: Multiple bursts for excellent scores (90+)
- **Rainbow Glow**: Color cycling effect on letters for perfect scores
- **Letter Animations**: Shake for low scores, glow/scale for high scores
- **Floating Stars**: Rising stars effect for celebrations

## Known Issues Resolved
- ‚úÖ White screen issue - Fixed with MinimalGame.jsx implementation
- ‚úÖ React development UI showing - Removed template components
- ‚úÖ Game not starting after difficulty selection - Simplified scene system
- ‚úÖ Text size too small - Increased to 300px
- ‚úÖ Scoring system - Implemented 0-100 scale with appropriate feedback
- ‚úÖ All letters working - Full 30-letter progression implemented

## Last Session Summary
User requested enhanced scoring system with:
- Bigger text (‚úÖ 300px font)
- 100-point scoring per letter (‚úÖ implemented)
- Below 50 = try again (‚úÖ with shake animation)
- 75+ = reward animation (‚úÖ star particles)
- 90+ = celebration animation (‚úÖ fireworks + floating stars + rainbow)

All features successfully implemented and tested. Game is fully functional.
